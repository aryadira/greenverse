Over- or under-irrigating a landscape can possibly increase disease incidence, waste water and decrease overall landscape condition.  Irrigation system efficiency is dependent upon several factors including design, installation and specific site conditions. Water applied to a landscape can account for a significant portion of a property’s water use. In Oklahoma, outdoor water use accounts for approximately 30 percent to 50 percent of household water use. A substantial amount of water is lost to evaporation, wind and runoff as a consequence of improper watering methods.  Reducing or eliminating this loss decreases utility bills and creates a more water efficient, healthy landscape.",

Choosing the correct technology for the situation is essential to achieve potential water savings.

Additionally, a study conducted on St. Augustine turfgrass showed an average irrigation savings of 43 percent in the summer compared to homeowner-scheduled irrigation, with no reduction in turfgrass quality (Davis et al., 2009).

Instead of using weather data, soil moisture sensor controllers utilize a soil moisture sensor placed belowground in the root zone of lawns to determine water need.  The soil moisture sensor estimates the soil volumetric water content.  Volumetric water content represents the portion of the total volume of soil occupied by water. The controllers can be adjusted to open the valves and start irrigation once the volumetric water content reaches a user-defined threshold.  The appropriate threshold value depends on soil and vegetation type and usually ranges from about 10 percent to 40 percent.  Soil moisture sensors must be installed in a representative area of the turf; far enough from sprinkler heads, tree roots, sidewalks and walls (Figure 3).",
